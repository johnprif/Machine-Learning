## Overview

These **Machine Learning Lab Exercises** are part of an academic curriculum in Python, designed to give students practical experience with both deep learning and classical machineâ€‘learning methods. Students build imageâ€‘classification models using **TensorFlow**, implement algorithms such as kâ€‘Nearest Neighbor with Euclidean distance, and then compare accuracy and performance across approaches.

## ðŸ”¥ Features

- **Deep Learning**: Image classification pipelines built with TensorFlowâ€™s highâ€‘level Keras API.  
- **Classical ML**: Implementation of kâ€‘NN, decision trees, and logistic regression from scratch and via scikitâ€‘learn.  
- **Performance Comparison**: Automated evaluation scripts compute accuracy, precision, recall, and runtime for each model.  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Demonstrations of normalization, train/test splits, and crossâ€‘validation.  
- **Reporting**: Each lab includes a PDF report detailing methodology, results, and insights.
